# Machine Learning implementation on Embedded FPGA
## Software ML model development
### Basic Setup
Basic setup for software model development only need conda(anaconda/miniconda) and jupyter notebook, where specific dependencied are all in environment.yaml file.
Given that the size of the dataset, working at S3DF is preferable.
### Dataset
The Smart Pixel dataset is available at https://zenodo.org/records/10783560. There is also an available notebook for processing the data into .hdf5 file for easier processing.
### model development
Different model development notebook and existing models are all available at software directory.
## High Level Synthesis
### Basic Setup
